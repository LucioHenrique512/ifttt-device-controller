**Notes**:
Functionally, this release just updates dependencies to resolve npm audit
warnings, but I'm dropping official support for Node 6 so the minor release
version number got bumped. I haven't changed any configs so it should still
work, but we won't be testing against it in CI builds anymore, since it's quite
old now, and any issues that pop up will be resolved with "upgrade Node."
